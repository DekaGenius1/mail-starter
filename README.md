### Configuration

You need to set some environment variables both in `frontend` and in `backend`.

In each folder, you need to create `.env` file based on `.env.sample` (just copy whatever is inside `.env.sample` into `.env` and fill with your values).

In `backend`, you need to add `.env` into `config` folder. In `frontend`, add it at the root of the project.
